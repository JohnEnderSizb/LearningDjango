# **NOTES**



# CREATE VIRTUAL ENV

* ``` python3 -m venv --system-site-packages ./venv ```

## ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENV

* ``` source ./venv/bin/activate  # sh, bash, or zsh ```

## THEN

* ``` pip install --upgrade pip ```
* ``` pip list  # show packages installed within the virtual environment ```
* ``` deactivate  # don't exit until you're done ```

# INSTALL DJANGO

* ```python -m pip install Django```

# START PROJECT

* ```django-admin startproject mysite```

# RUN SERVER

* ``` python manage.py runserver  # inside your project directory ```

# CREATE AN APP

* Make sure you are in the same level as manage.py
* Your apps can live anywhere on your Python path. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll create our poll app in the same directory as your manage.py file so that it can be imported as its own top-level module, rather than a submodule of mysite.
* ``` manage.py startapp polls```

# MIGRATE DATABASE
* ```python manage.py migrate```
* Models have to be activated in settings

## RUNNING MIGRATIONS

* ```python manage.py makemigrations polls```
